Sanctions happen when the enemy clan sees a serious problem that suggests that we as a clan are not following FWA rules. These usually occur if too many people have war bases up, although that's not the only reason these can occur.

The full list of sanctions is here: 
3 points - Any war base (or a base that doesn't follow FWA guidelines, see here: http://tiny.cc/FWABaseGuide) 
1 point - A base that's not a war base, but has 4 or less errors. 
2 points - A base that has 5 or more errors. 

If we have too many points, we lose points as described in Section 3. 9-11 points equals 1 point lost, 12-14 points equals 2 points lost, and 15 or more points equals 3 points lost. This is bad, as it means we can now lose up to 3 total wars. This is, therefore, why we have to enforce the rules strictly.
