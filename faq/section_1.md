FWA stands for **Farm War Alliance**. It's a group of over 500 clans whose primary goal is to match against each other in arranged wars. Our main focus is to be able to exploit Clash's automatic matching system to harvest free loot by matching with other FWA clans instead of other clans in general. 

If done correctly, over 95% of the time we will match with another FWA clan. Rarely do we match against a clan that's not FWA (whether that's simply an unaffiliated clan, or a blacklisted clan.)
