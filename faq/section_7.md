Q: Can I have heroes down during war? 
A: Yes! We encourage it - unless we're in CWL, or matched against a blacklisted clan.

Q: What's our minimum town hall level?
A: 11. 

Q: Can I opt out of war? 
A: No. We always spin 50s - so opt out preferences are overridden. It shouldn't really matter, as doing your hits is really easy. 

Q: Do we donate defensive CC? 
A: No. Since attacks are to be done without effort, no defensive CC should be donated. The only time we will donate defensive CC is during a blacklist war and CWL. 

Q: How do I tell if the enemy clan is FWA? 
A: Search for “:gem:FWA:gem:” in the description. If it's there, it's a FWA clan. 

Q: Where do I find a FWA compliant layout? 
A: Check #layouts.

Q: How does CWL distribution work? 
A: Short answer -- it's a weighted distribution. You get one entry for every hit you do, plus one entry for each consecutive month you have not left the clan for (maximum of six months). Once you receive a bonus, you are then ineligible for all future bonuses until there are no more eligible people. Then, the list is reset. (Caveat: You must do at least one hit to be eligible for the weighted distribution.) 

Q: Can I visit friends in other clans momentarily? 
A: If you give notice in Discord, yes; otherwise, no. (In-game doesn't count.) This is because if we see a member deficit right before a spin, we might have to fill it and end up locking you out. 

Q: What is the primary language of the clan?
A: Our primary language is English. While we will not penalize those who speak other languages, neither will we moderate or pay attention to anything that's not in English.

Q: What are the general conduct rules?
A: Be polite and mature. Avoid actions that negatively impact the clan or RCS community. Inform leadership through Discord if you will be inactive for an extended period. We play fair; use of bots or mods will result in a ban.

Q: What are the requirements for upgrading my Town Hall?
A: You must max out the majority of your TH level before upgrading; ask for permission if you wish to rush. The majority is defined as having 25% or less upgrades remaining in either heroes, laboratory, or buildings. Once you have reached this point, you are clear to upgrade. *(Pets and equipment do not count for or against this; as those are dependent on your playstyle. We expect that you're progressing the ones you use, but we don't expect you to max out everything, especially if you don't use them.)*
