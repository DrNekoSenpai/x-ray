Recently, we have evolved into a two-clan system, with one clan being Reddit X-ray, and the other clan being Faint Outlaws. This system was put into place because we have too many members to fit into one clan -- however, it does come with a few noteworthy concerns about ruling. 

For now, here is how rules will work between clans; 
- Accounts, whether mains or alts, **in Faint Outlaws**, cannot receive strikes -- this is because Faint Outlaws is still in the process of being rebuilt. When, at a time that we feel that Faint Outlaws is done being rebuilt, this rule will be rescinded. 
- If you have multiple accounts across both clans, then we will by default designate your account in Reddit X-ray as your main. Your main account is the only account that can receive strikes. 
- You can change this account by speaking to me. This account will also change if your main account leaves the clan, by being kicked or leaving permanently. If this occurs, I will set your next highest town hall account as your new main. 
- Due to the first rule, if you have accounts in both clans, you may not change your main account to an account in Faint Outlaws unless you have none in Reddit X-ray. 

**These rules are still being playtested, so if you have concerns or questions, do feel free to bring them up or ask.**
