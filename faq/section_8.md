Q: Can I have heroes down during war? 
A: Yes! We encourage it - unless we're in CWL, or matched against a blacklisted clan.

Q: Can I opt out of war? 
A: No. We always spin 50s - so opt out preferences are overridden. It shouldn't really matter, as doing your hits is really easy. 

Q: Do we donate defensive CC? 
A: No. Since attacks are to be done without effort, no defensive CC should be donated. The only time we will donate defensive CC is during a blacklist war and CWL. 

Q: How do I tell if the enemy clan is FWA? 
A: Search for “:gem:FWA:gem:” in the description. If it's there, it's a FWA clan. 

Q: Where do I find a FWA compliant layout? 
A: Check #layouts.

Q: How does CWL distribution work? 
A: Short answer -- it's a weighted distribution. You get one entry for every hit you do, plus one entry for each consecutive month you have not left the clan for (maximum of six months). This does mean that everyone is eligible, even those that missed a lot of hits, or have only joined the clan recently. (Caveat: You must do at least one hit to be eligible for the weighted distribution.) 

Q: Can I visit friends in other clans momentarily? 
A: If you give notice in Discord, yes; otherwise, no. (In-game doesn't count.) This is because if we see a member deficit right before a spin, we might have to fill it and end up locking you out.
