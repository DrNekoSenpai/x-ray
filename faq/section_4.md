Strikes are how we enforce the rules. You can see the most recent strikes awarded in #strikes, and what actions incur strikes. Gaining one or two is okay - or even four. However, as soon as you gain five, you'll be kicked from the clan - but not the server - until the next CWL ends. 

If you disobey the rules in a way that makes you a potential danger to the clan - whether it's having a war base set, or missing attacks, or disobeying instructions as discussed in Section 2, you will receive strikes. Therefore, try not to do this and you'll be fine.

Sometimes, you will see that strikes are not updated for a while. I decide as a whole for each month whether enforcing strikes at all is worth it or not; usually they get overlooked if we have a lot of alt accounts in the clan; as having too few accounts can jeopardize our ability to spin. If this is true, it is likely we will not enforce strikes at all.
