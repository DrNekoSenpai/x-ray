We have a complete list of rules in #clan-rules. **However**, the channel is long and to be honest, a fair number of these are situational, not as important, or read like an outline instead of a set of a few concentrated rules. Here are the main rules that everyone must follow: 

1) You must have a FWA compliant base set as your active war base at all times, unless we are currently in a blacklisted war or participating in CWL. There are no exceptions to this. Failure to set your FWA base results in strikes (see Section 4). 

*Exception: We have a grace period the war after a blacklist war (see section 6) where we don't receive sanctions even if we have a couple war bases up. Therefore, on the off chance that we roll a blacklist war, we will not award strikes the war after it for having a war base.* 

2) You must do both of your hits every war. This is not difficult to do, as all you need to do is hit your mirror for 2 or 3 stars, and then snipe a top 5 base. 

*Exceptions: You are not required to do your hits on any alt accounts you bring into the clan, provided that you have more than one account here. We also don't enforce missing hits if you only use one of your hits but not the other - provided that the hit you used was to attack your mirror for 2 or 3 stars. We also don't enforce strikes if you used your hit but you didn't get enough stars - you technically did do your hit in this case, so we'll look the other way.* 

3) You must follow all war instructions given in #clan-mails-xray - this means 3 starring during a win, 2 starring during a loss, and only sniping for the allowed number of stars. 

Why do we enforce these rules? It's because if we've got too many members disobeying instructions, we risk gaining sanctions which hurt our win probability. How do sanctions work? Scroll down to Section 5.
