# Rules

Reddit X-Ray has a certain set of rules and all members are required to follow them. If someone is found in violation of any rule(s) they will be warned. In extreme cases, it'll lead to a kick, or even a ban from the clan or the entirety of RCS, depending on the offense.

All members are required to read and abide by these rules.

# General Rules

ðŸ“Œ **1.1** Be polite and mature.
ðŸ“Œ **1.2** If you're seen to have a negative impact on the clan or the RCS community, you will be kicked.
ðŸ“Œ **1.3** If you're going to be inactive for a while let leadership know through discord.
ðŸ“Œ **1.4** X-Ray is a fair play clan, we play hard but we play fair. Use of bots/mods will earn you a ban.

# Activity Requirements

ðŸ“Œ **2.1** We allow perma 10s+ as long as there are signs of adequate activity such as completing war attacks, number of attacks won per season and by socializing in game chats or discord. Everyone must have the league badge within the first two days of season reset.
ðŸ“Œ **2.2** Members are required to max out their current TH level before moving up. If you want to rush your town hall, you must ask permission to upgrade. If you're upgrading because you're running out of things to upgrade, you do not need to ask permission.
ðŸ“Œ **2.3** Members are not allowed to hop between clans unless they've informed Leadership beforehand. *(Only applies to main accounts, you may shuffle alts as you like.)*
ðŸ“Œ **2.4** Certain actions, like missing hits/failing to meet the CG requirement/etc, will earn you one or more strikes. If you accumulate 5 strikes, you will be kicked. *(More details available in #strikes)*

# Donations

ðŸ“Œ **3.1** You must accept troops of all levels. We are a level 20+ clan so all troops donated are upgraded +2 levels.
ðŸ“Œ **3.2** If there's an open request that you can fill before your request, you're obliged to fill it unless it's a war request (CWL or blacklist wars only) and you cannot donate max troops.
ðŸ“Œ **3.3** Always take max troops in your clan castle if it's a war request (again, CWL or blacklist wars only).
ðŸ“Œ **3.4** Be fair and considerate, request as much as you like but not at the expense of your clan mates.
ðŸ“Œ **3.5** To apply as a rushed/donation account, you must be able to donate around 1/2 of common war troops at max level.

# War Rules

ðŸ“Œ **4.1** Leadership will post a clan mail and an announcement in #clan-mails-xray during preparation day. Please follow the instructions as mentioned.
ðŸ“Œ **4.2** War search times vary, attack at your convenience. You are only allowed to hit your mirror for a 3 star (if it's a win war) or 2 star (if it's a loss war), and then snipe a top base.
ðŸ“Œ **4.3** Warring with heroes down is allowed. *Only valid for FWA wars, you're expected to have all but one heroes up for CWL.*
ðŸ“Œ **4.4** There are no deadlines to attack in wars. Although, in the last 4 hours of war, bases are open to all.
ðŸ“Œ **4.5** If your mirror in war has a war base, or has a noticeable error, inform `@Leadership` in #war-discussion so we can notify the enemy clan. If it's the former, you'll also be allowed to snipe the top two bases. 
ðŸ“Œ **4.6** If you are found not to be following instructions posted in clan mail or #clan-mails-xray, then you will receive strikes. 
ðŸ“Œ **4.7** Attacks during mismatched wars are optional.
ðŸ“Œ **4.8** If you snipe a top base, but forget to use your second attack, it counts as missing both attacks.
ðŸ“Œ **4.9** If you've got a war timer by the (secret) war search time, you'll be kick-vited.
ðŸ“Œ **4.10** Having a war base during a FWA war's battle day will result in strikes. *Does not apply the sync after a blacklist war.* 
ðŸ“Œ **4.11** Attacks are only mandatory for your main account - you are not required to complete attacks on any alt accounts you have in the clan, provided you have more than one account here.

# Clan War Leagues

ðŸ“Œ **5.1** A Google sign-up form will be posted in Discord a week or so prior to CWL start. You are required to fill out the form if you want to register yourself for that respective season. If you'd like to make changes, notify me either in a DM, in #general, or in #war-discussion with the changes you'd like made.
ðŸ“Œ **5.2** We ask our members who are opted in to temporarily suspend any major upgrades (heroes, spell factories etc.) that reduce your strength during the week of CWL so that we can ensure maximum participation.
ðŸ“Œ **5.3** We will spin 30v30. If you have signed up, you are guaranteed to be in for all 7 days.
ðŸ“Œ **5.4** We will fill the rest of the 30 slots with people who have not signed up. If you have opted out for that season, you are exempt from being put in. 
ðŸ“Œ **5.5** If there are more than 30 members signed up, members will be opted out starting from the very bottom (by war weight).
ðŸ“Œ **5.6** Performance is only evaluated for bonus medal distribution. We do not give strikes based on performance, although it's probably a good idea to get 8 or more stars to get the full amount of medals possible. We will, however, give strikes for hits missed.
ðŸ“Œ **5.7** During CWL, all bases are first-come first-serve. However, should you have a particular target in mind, but you are **unable** to attack it immediately, we request that you flag it, so that other players know that you are planning on attacking it. If you have a target in mind, but it is already flagged, please look elsewhere. 
ðŸ“Œ **5.8** We will disregard flags if it is **less than 4 hours before the end of war.** In other words, if you have a target in mind, it is flagged by someone else, but there are 4 or less hours in war -- you can safely ignore the flag and attack it.
ðŸ“Œ **5.9** Once the roster for CWL is set **and** the first battle day has begun, the roster is **immutable** and cannot be changed. If you wanted to be in, and forgot to sign up -- you're out of luck. Similarly, if you were put in and want to be taken out -- you're also out of luck. We do not change the roster for any reason.
ðŸ“Œ **5.10** The only exception for the above rule is if a player is willingly opting out, and there is someone else that wants to take their place. Both people must notify me if this is the case, and I will swap you two.
ðŸ“Œ **5.11** CWL bonuses work on a weighted distribution. You get one entry for every hit you do, plus one entry for each consecutive month you have not left the clan for (maximum of six months). This does mean that everyone is eligible, even those that missed a lot of hits, or have only joined the clan recently. (Caveat: You must do at least one hit to be eligible for the weighted distribution.) We keep track of who has or has not received a bonus, and those who do become ineligible until the list is reset; when there are no more eligible people.

# Promotions

ðŸ“Œ **6.1** Promotions in game are awarded at my discretion based on an individual's activity, maturity and how helpful they are in game or in discord. Asking for promotions will surely not get you the position.

# Inactivity

ðŸ“Œ **7.1** If you know you're going to be inactive, inform leadership via a private message on discord or tagging @Leadership on discord. You will most likely need to leave the clan ingame if you're going to be inactive, as war hits are required of all members.
